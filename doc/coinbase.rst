Coinbase support
================

The coinbase package adds support for paper trading strategies through Coinbase exchange
(https://www.coinbase.com/).

Coinbase support depends on:
 * **ws4py** (https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python) 
 * **tornado** (http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
 * **bintrees** (https://bitbucket.org/mozman/bintrees)

so be sure to have those installed before moving forward.
